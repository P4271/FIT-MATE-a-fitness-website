        solution:"Avoid dehydration: Drink plenty of liquids every day. The amount depends on what you eat, your sex, your level of activity, the weather, your health, your age and medications you take. Fluids help your muscles contract and relax and keep muscle cells hydrated and less irritable. During activity, replenish fluids at regular intervals, and continue drinking water or other fluids after you're finished.  Stretch your muscles: Stretch before and after you use any muscle for an extended period. If you tend to have leg cramps at night, stretch before bedtime. Light exercise, such as riding a stationary bicycle for a few minutes before bedtime, also may help prevent cramps while you're sleeping.",

Joint muscular imbalance: Each of the muscles that surround a joint work together with opposing force that keeps the bones of the joint centered for optimum movement. If one or more of these muscles becomes weaker, stronger, looser, or tighter than normal, you have a muscle imbalance and joint movement can be limited.",

        solution:"When it comes to exercise, variety actually is a good thing. A lot of traditional exercises can be modified to provide better care for aching joints. For example, instead of doing planks with hands pressed into the ground, position yourself on your forearms, which takes the pressure off of your shoulders and wrists. You can also use props to help keep unnecessary pressure off of your joints, such as putting yoga blocks under your hands when you’re doing pushups. Individuals suffering from joint pain may also benefit from shifting their weight off of their aching areas. For example, if your knees are a frequent problem, consider doing squats by moving your weight off of your knees and into your heels. Not only will this shift take pressure off of your knees, but it actually can help activate your glutes and tone your backside. Double bonus! It can be tempting to cut your workout short and skip stretching, but when you’re suffering from joint pain, doing this can actually increase your pain later on. Why? Because having tight muscles can increase your joint pain, decrease motion and make future workouts more painful. While your muscles are warm from your workout, it’s important to spend time gently stretching out each muscle group, being careful to spend 20-30 seconds on each stretch. This will set you up for less pain the next time you hit the gym.​",

When you increase the weight, sets, reps, intensity, the number of sessions completed each week, the amount of rest taken between sets or use variations of exercises, you encourage a “training response” to occur. Nutrition plays an important role in your fitness progress, and to keep improving, you need a nutrition plan that supports your training. This means getting enough protein, carbohydrates, healthy fats and the micronutrients you need to build muscle and recover quickly.  ​",
