                          <p className="cardio-para">Jogging or running is a popular form of physical activity. About one in five Australians try running (or jogging) at some stage in their life. Running is an appealing exercise because it doesn't cost a lot to take part and you can run at any time that suits you.Some runners choose to participate in fun runs, athletics races or marathons. If you are interested in competing with other runners, contact your local running club.</p>
                          <h3 className="text-center">Health benefits of running and jogging</h3>
                          <p className="cardio-para">Regular running or jogging offers many health benefits. Running can: <br /> help to build strong bones, as it is a weight bearing exercise <br /> strengthen muscles <br /> improve cardiovascular fitness <br /> burn plenty of kilojoules <br /> help maintain a healthy weight.</p>
                          <h3 className="text-center">Running versus jogging</h3>
                          <p className="cardio-para">The difference between running and jogging is intensity. Running is faster, uses more kilojoules and demands more effort from the heart, lungs and muscles than jogging. Running requires a higher level of overall fitness than jogging.Both running and jogging are forms of aerobic exercise. Aerobic means 'with oxygen' – the term 'aerobic exercise' means any physical activity that produces energy by combining oxygen with blood glucose or body fat.</p>

                          <p className="cardio-para">Biking is a top-notch cardio workout. You’ll burn about 400 calories an hour. Plus it strengthens your lower body, including your legs, hips, and glutes. If you want a workout that’s gentle on your back, hips, knees, and ankles, this is a great choice. You can cycle on the road, a bike path, or a mountain trail. Indoors, you can do your workout on a stationary bike or buy a stand, called an indoor trainer, for your outdoor bike. If you’re a beginner, choose a flat bike path or road. If you’re ready for a tougher workout that also engages your upper body and core, try mountain biking. It’s also called off-road biking. You can do it on trails and different types of rough terrain. Mountain biking is trickier because you have to navigate hills and surfaces, so your upper body and core will kick into gear. It’s more of a total-body workout than biking on the road, which is mostly a lower-body cardio workout.</p>
                          <h3 className="text-center">Intensity Level: High</h3>
                          <p className="cardio-para">Cycling gets your heart rate up almost as much as running and burns a lot of calories. It's also gentle on your body. It doesn't put a lot of stress on your joints, which helps if you’re getting into shape or have joint problems.</p>
                          <h3 className="text-center">Areas It Targets</h3>
                          <p className="cardio-para">- Core: Yes. Your core will get stronger from biking. <br />- Arms: No. This workout doesn't specifically target your arms. <br />- Legs: Yes. This is a great workout for your legs, especially your quads and hamstrings. <br />- Glutes: Yes. Your glutes and hips will get a serious workout from biking. <br />- Back: No. This workout doesn’t specifically target your back. If you want to add an upper body workout, try mountain biking. It will engage your back muscles as you navigate up and down hills.</p>

                          <p className="cardio-para">Rowing is an amazing aerobic exercise, which means it can help you with weight loss, increase your stamina, and even boost your immune system. Rowing also requires you to use a lot of major muscle groups, so it’s also an effective cardio workout. And because it helps you release endorphins, rowing regularly can even improve your mood and sleep quality.</p>
                          <h3 className="text-center">IT’S LOW IMPACT</h3>
                          <p className="cardio-para">If you’re overweight or have joint problems, you run the risk of injuring yourself by doing high-impact, weight-bearing exercises like running or hiking. Rowing is low-impact, which means it puts minimal stress on your joints and greatly reduces the risk of injury. This also makes it a great exercise for people who need to strengthen and condition their knees after injury.</p>
                          <h3 className="text-center">IT CAN STRENGTHEN YOUR BONES</h3>
                          <p className="cardio-para">Because running is a weight-bearing exercise, it actually helps you build bone density. And it’s actually believed to have a greater effect on bone density than other activities like resistance training and cycling. And despite popular belief that running creates joint problems, running can actually benefit your joints because of the cycle of compression and expansion that occurs.</p>

The guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. But even small amounts of physical activity are helpful. Being active for short periods of time throughout the day can add up to provide health benefits.</p>

More specifically, jumping jacks are a plyometric exercise. Plyometrics are explosive aerobic moves that increase speed, quickness, and power — and they work your whole body. </p>

                          <p className="cardio-para">Since jumping jacks elevate your heart rate, they can also improve your cardiovascular fitness. A 2014 study in BioMed Research International found that a four week high-intensity circuit training program, which included jumping jacks, improved several heart health markers in obese men. The participants saw improvements in their resting heart rate, blood pressure, cholesterol, and body fat levels. Interestingly, the improvements were comparable to those found in much longer-duration circuit, resistance training, and aerobic exercise programs. </p>
