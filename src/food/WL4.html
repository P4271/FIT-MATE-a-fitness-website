            Eggs, Black Beans, and Peppers<BR>
            Start your day with this protein-packed scramble. According to research in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, people who had eggs for breakfast ate less for the rest of a day and a half than those who had a bagel. Black beans and peppers make this morning meal even more filling, thanks to a double dose of fiber.
