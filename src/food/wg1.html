        <p><h1>Homemade protein smoothies<h1><br>
            Drinking homemade protein smoothies can be a highly nutritious and quick way to gain weight.<br>
            
            Making your own smoothies is the best way since commercial versions are often full of sugar and lack nutrients.<br>
             It also gives you full control over the flavor and nutrient content.<br>
            
            
            Here are just a few tasty variations you can try. 
            <br>You can combine each with 2 cups (470 mL) of dairy milk or soy milk if you have lactose intolerance. <br>Both have more nutrients and calories than other alternative milks.<br>
            
            Chocolate banana nut shake: Combine 1 banana, 1 scoop of chocolate whey protein, and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of peanut or another nut butter.<br>
            Vanilla berry shake: Combine 1 cup (237 mL) of fresh or frozen mixed berries, ice, 1 cup (237 mL) of high protein, full fat Greek yogurt, and 1 scoop of vanilla whey protein.<br>
            Chocolate hazelnut shake: Combine 15 ounces (444 mL) of chocolate milk with 1 scoop of chocolate whey protein, 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of hazelnut butter, and 1 avocado.<br>
            Caramel apple shake: Combine 1 sliced apple, 1 cup (237 mL) of full fat Greek yogurt, 1 scoop of caramel- or vanilla-flavored whey protein, and 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of sugar-free caramel sauce or flavoring.<br>
            Vanilla blueberry shake: Combine 1 cup (237 mL) of fresh or frozen blueberries, 1 scoop of vanilla whey protein, 1 cup (237 mL) of vanilla Greek yogurt, and sweetener if needed.<br>
            Super green shake: Combine 1 cup (237 mL) of spinach, 1 avocado, 1 banana, 1 cup (237 mL) of pineapple, and 1 scoop of unflavored or vanilla whey protein.<br>
