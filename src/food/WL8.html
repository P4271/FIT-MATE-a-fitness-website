            Yogurt and Raspberries<BR>
            This creamy treat may help turn up the fat burn.<BR> Research suggests that people who get more calcium and vitamin D as part of a weight loss plan shed more fat than those who donâ€™t. <BR>So, look for a vitamin D-fortified yogurt, which serves up about 35% of all the calcium you need in a day. Top it with half a cup of raspberries for sweetness and 4 grams of fiber.</div>
