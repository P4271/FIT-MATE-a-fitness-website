            Steak and Broccoli<BR>
 Beef is rich in protein and iron, which your body uses to build red blood cells. <BR>They take oxygen to your organs, so falling short in those can zap your energy. <BR>Broccoli is the perfect side, because its vitamin C helps your body take in iron.<BR> A half-cup of this veggie has 65% of all the vitamin C you need in a day.
